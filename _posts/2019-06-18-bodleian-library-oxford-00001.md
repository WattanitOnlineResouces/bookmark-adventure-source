## Leather bookmark

![](/uploads/0001-bodleian-library-02.jpg)

This is my first ever bookmark that I intentionally bought, and thus began my obsession about collecting bookmark.

It all started off when I brought up a conversation about how cool it was for a person to single-mindedly collect only one kind of souvenirs from around the globe. It wasn't important what the souvenirs were - could be postcards, timbles, magnets, or anything else - as long as they kept collecting the same thing into a large collection. Otherwise, those souvenirs were more or less just some clutters. Since that conversation, I had been looking for "the one thing" I wanted to collect as souvenirs.

When my friends and I visited the City of Oxford and its famous libraries and colleges, I found this beautiful leather bookmark in the gift shop of Bodleian Library. Recalling that I saw a lot of bookmarks being sold in many places, I knew that this was the thing. I love books so what could be a better souvenir than a bookmark!

This one bookmark started it all.

### About the place

The Bodleian Library is the main research library of the University of Oxford, and is one of the oldest libraries in Europe. With over 12 million items, it is the second-largest library in Britain after the British Library. 

Known to Oxford scholars as "Bodley" or "the Bod", it operates principally as a reference library and, in general, documents may not be removed from the reading rooms.
